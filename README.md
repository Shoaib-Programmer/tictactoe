# Tic-Tac-Toe

* This is a simple website built using React and Vite, where users can play a bot that plays optimal tic-tac-toe, and doesn't ever lose.

* This website uses the minimax algorithm to decide on the best move in any position, and uses alpha-beta pruning for speed.

* It is compiled to HTML, CSS and JS and is hosted on GitHub pages at https://Shoaib-Programmer.github.io/tictactoe through the gh-pages branch of this repo.

* This website is essentially a web version of CS50AI's tic-tac-toe project, combined with the hands-on tutorial shown in react.dev/learn, which I used to familiarize my self with React and its syntax.
